%description
OBS kiwi_post_run hook to wrap a kiwi-produced image in an rpm package.

This package should be required by the Build Service project's meta
prjconf, so that the kiwi_post_run hook is present in the kiwi image
and gets executed at the end of the image build.  It will then build
an rpm which contains the newly-produced image from kiwi (using
image.spec.in), and place the rpm in the correct location that it
becomes an additional build artefact.
